# Text-Editor

I followed a tutorial to make a text-editor in python. This uses tkinter for the gui. Most of the other work is simply working with files. 

Here is the link for the tutorial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Sfru99QNA&ab_channel=TechWithTim

I plan to eventually find ways to add features to it.
